## Monitor Render Deployment

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Watch Build Logs**
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Database connection established`
   - Look for: `üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:10000`
   - Should NOT see: `Database not connected` errors

3. **Expected Log Output:**
   ```
   üîå Connecting to database...
   ‚úÖ Database connection established
   ‚è∞ Database time: [timestamp]
   üöÄ Server running on http://localhost:10000
   ```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Test Database Connection (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test immediately after deployment
curl https://trucklogistics-api.onrender.com/api/health

# Wait 2 minutes, test again
sleep 120
curl https://trucklogistics-api.onrender.com/api/health

# Wait 3 more minutes, test again
sleep 180
curl https://trucklogistics-api.onrender.com/api/health
```

### 2. Test Login (Critical)

- [ ] Wait 2 minutes, login again
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes, login again
- [ ] All should work without "Database not connected" error

### 3. Test UI Updates (Provider Account)
- [ ] Login as provider
- [ ] Go to a pending booking
- [ ] Click "Approve Booking"
  - ‚úÖ Status should change to "Approved" immediately

  useMemo in BookingDetail re-evaluating. Bookings count: X
  getAvailableActions recalculating with booking status: [status]
  Status update result: [result]
  ```
- [ ] Should NOT see errors

### 6. Monitor Render Logs (15 minutes)
- [ ] Keep Render logs open
- [ ] Look for keep-alive queries (every 25 seconds):
  ```
  Keep-alive query successful
  ```
- [ ] Should NOT see:
  ```
  Database pool error
  Database not connected
  ```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All tests pass:**
- Database stays connected for 15+ minutes
- Login works at any time
- UI updates instantly without refresh
- No errors in browser console
- No errors in Render logs

## If Issues Occur

### Database Connection Issues
1. Check Render logs for specific error
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable

git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```
