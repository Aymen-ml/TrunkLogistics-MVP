# Password Reset Fix - Elastic Email Configuration

## üîç Problem Identified

The "Failed to send reset email" error occurs because:
1. **SendGrid API key** was set to placeholder value `your_sendgrid_api_key`
2. Email service couldn't send emails without valid credentials
3. The forgot password functionality failed silently

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Configured **Elastic Email** (free tier: 100 emails/day, no credit card required)

### On Render (Production) - Already Done ‚úÖ
You've configured these environment variables:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.elasticemail.com
EMAIL_PORT=2525
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=korichiaymen27@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-elastic-email-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=korichiaymen27@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=TrunkLogistics
```

### On Local (Development) - Updated
Updated `server/.env` with Elastic Email configuration.

## üîë Get Your Elastic Email API Key

If you haven't already:

1. **Go to**: https://elasticemail.com/
2. **Login** with your account
3. **Navigate to**: Settings ‚Üí SMTP/API
4. **Find existing API key** or **Create new**:
   - Click "Create Additional API Key"
   - Name: `TrunkLogistics-Local`
   - Permissions: Check "SMTP"
   - Click "Create"
   - **Copy the API Key** immediately!

5. **Update local `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/aymen/Downloads/LogisticApp-main/server
   nano .env  # or use your editor
   ```
   
   Replace:
   ```env
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-elastic-email-api-key-here
   ```
   
   With:
   ```env
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY
   ```

## üöÄ How to Test

### 1. Restart Local Server
```bash
cd /home/aymen/Downloads/LogisticApp-main/server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Password Reset
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/forgot-password
2. Enter a valid email (your Gmail: korichiaymen27@gmail.com)
3. Click "Send Reset Link"
4. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
5. Click the reset link
6. Set a new password
7. Login with new password

## üìß Email Service Configuration

The email service in `server/src/services/emailService.js` now uses:

### Configuration Priority:
1. If `EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail` ‚Üí Uses Gmail SMTP
2. If `EMAIL_SERVICE=sendgrid` ‚Üí Uses SendGrid
3. **Otherwise** ‚Üí Uses generic SMTP (Elastic Email) ‚úÖ

### Current Setup (Elastic Email):
- **Host**: smtp.elasticemail.com
- **Port**: 2525 (recommended) or 587
- **Security**: TLS (not SSL)
- **Auth**: Username (email) + API Key (password)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "Failed to send reset email"

**Check 1: Verify EMAIL_PASSWORD is set**
```bash
cd /home/aymen/Downloads/LogisticApp-main/server
grep EMAIL_PASSWORD .env
```
Should show your actual API key, not placeholder.

**Check 2: Verify sender email is verified in Elastic Email**
1. Go to: https://elasticemail.com/account#/settings/manage-senders
2. Make sure `korichiaymen27@gmail.com` has green checkmark ‚úÖ

**Check 3: Check server logs**
```bash
# When server is running, look for:
"Email service initialized successfully"
"Password reset email sent to: [email]"
```

**Check 4: Test email service connection**
Add this temporary test endpoint in your server if needed.

### Issue: Email goes to spam

This is normal for new SMTP accounts. Solutions:
1. **Mark as "Not Spam"** in Gmail
2. **Wait 1-2 days** for reputation to build
3. **Add sender to contacts** in Gmail
4. Elastic Email reputation improves with usage

### Issue: API key not working

**Verify**:
1. API key has "SMTP" permission enabled
2. No extra spaces when copying API key
3. Sender email is verified in Elastic Email dashboard
4. Account status is active (not suspended)

## üìä Elastic Email Dashboard

Monitor your email sending:
- **Go to**: https://elasticemail.com/account#/reports
- **View**: Sent emails, delivery rate, opens, clicks
- **Check**: Daily quota (100 emails free tier)

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Never commit API keys to Git**
   - Already in `.gitignore`: `.env`
   - Verify: `git status` should not show `.env`

2. **Use different API keys for different environments**
   - Production (Render): One API key
   - Development (Local): Different API key
   - This allows you to track usage separately

3. **Rotate API keys periodically**
   - Delete old keys in Elastic Email dashboard
   - Create new keys every 3-6 months

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist
