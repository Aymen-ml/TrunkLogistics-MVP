# Availability Filter and Visual Indicators Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement improves the truck search experience by adding an availability filter and clear visual indicators to help customers easily identify which trucks are available for booking and which are currently rented.

## Implementation Date
October 20, 2025

## Problem Solved
Previously, customers could see all trucks in the search results but couldn't easily tell which ones were available. They had to:
1. Click on each truck
2. Try to book it
3. Only then discover it was unavailable

This created a frustrating user experience with wasted time and failed booking attempts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Availability Filter Dropdown
**Location:** Truck search page filters section

**Options:**
- **All Trucks/Equipment** - Shows everything (default)
- **Available Only** - Shows only trucks with no active bookings
- **Rented Only** - Shows only trucks with active bookings

**Features:**
- Client-side filtering for instant results
- Dynamically updates based on service type (Transport/Rental)
- Works in combination with other filters
- State persists during search session

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const filteredTrucks = trucks.filter(truck => {
  if (filters.availability === 'available') {
    return truck.active_bookings_count === 0;
  } else if (filters.availability === 'rented') {
    return truck.active_bookings_count > 0;
  }
  return true; // 'all' - show everything
});
```

### 2. Visual Indicators on Truck Cards

#### A. Red Banner for Rented Trucks
**Display:** Top of truck card
**Styling:** Red background with prominent text
**Message:** "Currently Rented - Not Available"

```jsx
{isRented && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border-b border-red-200 px-4 py-2">
    <p className="text-xs font-medium text-red-800 text-center">
      Currently Rented - Not Available
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### B. Disabled Booking Button
**When Rented:**
- Button text changes to "Currently Booked" / "Currently Rented"
- Gray background (bg-gray-300)
- Gray text (text-gray-500)
- Cursor shows not-allowed
- Click event disabled

**When Available:**
- Blue background (bg-blue-600)
- White text
- Hover effect
- Fully functional

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => !isRented && requestBooking(truck.id)}
  disabled={isRented}
  className={`flex-1 ${
    isRented 
      ? 'bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed' 
      : 'bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white'
  }`}
>
  {isRented ? 'Currently Booked' : 'Request Booking'}
</button>
```

#### C. Card Styling Changes
**Rented Trucks:**
- Reduced opacity (opacity-75)
- Darker border (border-gray-300 vs border-gray-200)
- Less prominent appearance

**Available Trucks:**
- Full opacity
- Normal border
- Prominent appearance

#### D. Availability Badges
**Already implemented in previous feature:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green "Available" badge
- ðŸ”´ Red "Rented" badge
- Displayed next to service type badge

### 3. Results Summary

**Display:** Above truck cards grid
**Information Shown:**
- Filtered count vs total count
- Filter status (if filtered)
- Breakdown of available vs rented (when showing all)

**Examples:**
```
Showing 8 of 12 trucks (available only)

Showing 15 of 15 trucks
5 available â€¢ 10 rented

Showing 3 of 15 equipment (rented only)
```

**Implementation:**
```jsx
{trucks.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-4 flex items-center justify-between">
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
      Showing {filteredTrucks.length} of {trucks.length} trucks
      {filters.availability !== 'all' && (
        <span> ({filters.availability} only)</span>
      )}
    </p>
    {filters.availability === 'all' && (
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
        <span className="text-green-600">
          {trucks.filter(t => t.active_bookings_count === 0).length} available
        </span>
        {' â€¢ '}
        <span className="text-red-600">
          {trucks.filter(t => t.active_bookings_count > 0).length} rented
        </span>
      </p>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Enhanced Empty States

**When No Trucks Found:**
- Checks if trucks exist but are filtered out
- Shows appropriate message:
  - "Try adjusting your search criteria" (no trucks at all)
  - "No available trucks match your criteria. Try changing the availability filter." (trucks exist but filtered out)

**Implementation:**
```jsx
{filteredTrucks.length === 0 ? (
  <div className="...">
    <p>
      {trucks.length === 0 
        ? `Try adjusting your search criteria...`
        : `No ${filters.availability} trucks match your criteria...`
      }
    </p>
  </div>
) : (
  // Show results
)}
```

## User Experience Flow

5. All displayed trucks have green "Available" badges
6. No disabled/grayed out trucks
7. Can immediately book any truck shown

### Scenario 2: Customer Browsing All Trucks

## Technical Details

### State Management
```javascript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  // ... other filters
  availability: 'all' // all, available, rented
});
```

### Filter Logic
- **Client-side filtering** - No additional API calls needed
- Uses `active_bookings_count` from truck data
- Instant filtering when selection changes

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal** - Filtering happens client-side
- No additional database queries
- No extra API calls
- Simple array filter operation

### Accessibility
- Disabled buttons use proper `disabled` attribute
- Clear visual indicators for screen readers
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
