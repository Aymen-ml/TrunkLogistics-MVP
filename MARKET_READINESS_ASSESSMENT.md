## üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. **Payment System - NOT IMPLEMENTED** üö®
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Cannot monetize platform  
**Current State:** No payment integration exists

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Integrate payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal recommended)
- [ ] Implement secure payment processing for bookings
- [ ] Add payment history and invoicing
- [ ] Set up payment webhooks for status updates
- [ ] Implement refund/cancellation policies
- [ ] Add payment security (PCI compliance)

**Recommended Solution:**
```javascript
// Stripe Integration Example
- Install: npm install stripe
- Add payment intent creation
- Secure payment confirmation
- Handle webhooks for async updates
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**Cost Impact:** Cannot launch without this

---

### 2. **Email Verification System - PARTIALLY BROKEN** üö®
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Users cannot verify accounts reliably  
**Current State:** Using temporary workaround, database tokens not working

**Issues Found:**
- ‚úÖ Email sending works (SendGrid configured)
- ‚ùå Email verification token system bypassed with temporary fix
- ‚ùå Database `email_verification_tokens` table exists but not used
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Verification relies on direct email links without database validation

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Fix email verification token creation in database
- [ ] Remove temporary bypass workaround
- [ ] Implement proper token expiration (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Add resend verification email functionality
- [ ] Test complete verification flow end-to-end

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

---

### 3. **Security Vulnerabilities** üö®
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Data breaches, legal liability  

**Issues Found:**

#### a) **JWT Token Security**
- ‚ùå JWT expiry set to 30 days (too long)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No refresh token mechanism
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Recommended: Reduce to 1 day, add refresh tokens
const JWT_EXPIRE = '1d'; // Instead of '30d'
// Implement HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
```

#### b) **File Upload Security**
- ‚úÖ File type validation exists
- ‚úÖ File size limits (5MB)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No virus scanning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct file access without authentication checks
- ‚ùå No file encryption at rest

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Add virus scanning (ClamAV)
- [ ] Implement signed URLs for file access
- [ ] Add rate limiting on uploads
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive documents

#### c) **SQL Injection Protection**
- ‚úÖ Using parameterized queries (good!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some raw SQL in admin queries needs review

#### d) **HTTPS Enforcement**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify production enforces HTTPS only
- [ ] Add HSTS headers
- [ ] Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 4. **Production Environment Issues** üö®
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** System instability, poor performance

**Issues Found:**

#### a) **Debug Code in Production**
- ‚ùå Console.log statements everywhere
- ‚ùå Debug endpoints still active (`/api/test`, `/api/diagnostics`)
- ‚ùå Detailed error messages expose system internals

**Required Actions:**
```javascript
// Remove before production:
- /api/test routes
- /api/diagnostics routes
- console.log() debugging
- Detailed error stack traces in responses
```

#### b) **Environment Configuration**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing production environment checks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No proper logging infrastructure (use Winston/Pino)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No error monitoring (add Sentry)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No performance monitoring

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Set up proper logging service (Winston)
- [ ] Integrate error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring (New Relic/DataDog)
- [ ] Create separate dev/staging/prod configs

#### c) **Database Performance**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing database indexes on frequently queried columns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No connection pooling configuration visible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No query optimization

**Add Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_customer_id ON bookings(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_provider_id ON bookings(provider_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_trucks_provider_id ON trucks(provider_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_trucks_status ON trucks(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_trucks_service_type ON trucks(service_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_id ON notifications(user_id);
